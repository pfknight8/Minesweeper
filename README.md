## **_Description_**

#### This project will be a knock-off version of the "classic" game minesweeper. Should be a good challenge. I've killed many a minute with this simple, yet engaging puzzle game, as it used to come standard on windows machines.
#### A 1-player game, the objective is to clear the grid without revealing any 'mines'; sounds simple enough, but it only takes one "hit" and game over.
#### More to come...

## **_Getting started_**

- [ ] Will need to create the necessary html, js, and css files.

- [ ] Will need to supply a basic set of elements & style to test the js (html & css).
- [ ] Will need to styl the game for presentation.
