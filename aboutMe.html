    <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <p>I am a software engineering student at General Assemby (SEI June - September 2022). I have created this project as a means to showcase what I have learned from unit 1 (front-end developement), and also because I enjoy the game minesweeper.<br /><br />Prior to taking this course, I was a part-time welder/fabricator, where I made custom pieces for a local reclaimed woodshop. Before that, I was a chemical engineer (BSE @ the University of Michigan), but after working off my debt, I realized I needed a change. Moving back up to Ohio and picking up the welding torch helped me in bridging the employment gap, but I still wanted to pursue something a little more technical for the long term.<br /><br />I'm someone who has always enjoyed exploring how things work. Working with my hands has certainly allowed me to do that in the physical sense, but I have also enjoyed the same from a programming perspective. I was first introduced to coding in college, at a very basic level. Since then, coding fell more into the range of hobby, picking things up as needed to accomplish some task. Whether it was teaching myself the ins & outs of Excel to do a project, or digging into the files of a favorite game to mod it, I found that, despite its frustrations, I actually get quite a bit of enjoyment out of the process.<br /><br />So that brings us to here, where I have immersed myself in the world of coding in the hopes of launching a new career in the field. This was a fun project for me, and I look forward to increasing my skillset, not just from this course, but in the years to come.
